<h1>Test 3</h1>
<pre id="test_3">With this online tool, you can wrap words in the given text. In the options, you can specify the maximum text line width and the program will wrap all words so that the width of each line doesn't exceed this width. For example, the width can be 60, 50, or 45 characters per line. By default, the program doesn't break words, which means the words that no longer entirely fit into a line are placed at the beginning of the next new line. If you activate the "Break Words" option, then the program will fill each line with as many characters as possible and will insert a hard line break in the middle of the last word, and place the ending part of this word on a new line. If the last word fits entirely in the current line and is followed by a space symbol, then the next line will start with a space. If you don't want to have this space at the beginning of the line, turn off the "Allow Leading Spaces" option. Textabulous!</pre>
